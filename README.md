# Funky Town

This is a small excercise of implementing a Finite State Machine for characters in an RPG style game.
The characters interact with each other in a suscription system and they express their feelings or words through a message globe above them.

This was developed in Unity 3D using Unity tutorial assets. The state machine logic is coded from scratch only using DoTween for traslations and the unity Nav Agent to find locations.

The player can move with ASDW and rotate the camera with the mouse.
